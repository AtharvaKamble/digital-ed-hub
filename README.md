### Digital EdHub - Objected Oriented Design

This was the capstone project for our INFO 5100 (Application Engineering and Development) course at Northeastern University. The purpose of this course was to get familiar with Object Oriented Design fundamentals with Java.


#### What's the project about?

The project maps a realistic setting like a university or school into classes and objects. The goal of the project was to achieve complete objected oreinted design with software that can emulate a de-centralized version of a university, hence **Ed-Hub**.


There's a professor login, student login, and a transcript generator microservice.

- **Professors:** can create programs, courses, schedules, and grade students assignments.

- **Students:** can enroll into programs and courses, view professors (filters by language, program, and course type), submit assignments, and leave reviews for professors and their courses.

- **Transcript microservice:** is the service that has a visual dashboard and data of all professors (including their programs, courses and reviews), and all students (their performances, reviews, and grades). The transcript microservice generates adademic transcripts for students once their program is successfully completed.
